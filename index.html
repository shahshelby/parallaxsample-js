        <h2>What is Parallax Scrolling</h2>
        <p>
            Parallax scrolling is a popular web design technique that creates an engaging user experience by making background images move more slowly than foreground content when you scroll down a webpage. This effect adds depth and dynamism to websites, making them visually appealing.<br></br>
            To achieve parallax scrolling, web developers typically use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Multiple layers of images or content are created, and they move at different speeds based on the user's scrolling behavior. This creates a visually stunning effect that captures the user's attention and provides a memorable browsing experience.<br></br>
            Parallax scrolling is often used in storytelling websites, product showcases, and landing pages to create a sense of immersion and interactivity. It can help convey a message, showcase products or services, and keep visitors engaged with your website.<br></br>

        <h2>How does Parallax Scrolling work?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Layered Content:</strong> Web developers create multiple layers of content or images, each representing a different depth on the webpage. These layers are stacked on top of each other, with the background layers moving more slowly than the foreground layers.<br><br>

            <strong>Mouse Movement:</strong> Parallax scrolling can also respond to mouse movement, creating a dynamic effect as the user interacts with the website. As the user moves the mouse, the different layers of content shift in response, adding depth and interactivity to the site.<br><br>

            <strong>Scrolling:</strong> The most common method of triggering parallax effects is scrolling. As the user scrolls down the webpage, the various layers move at different speeds, creating a sense of depth and immersion.<br><br>

            <strong>Storytelling:</strong> Parallax scrolling is often used in web design to tell a story or guide the user through a narrative. By revealing content in a layered, scrolling fashion, designers can create engaging and visually appealing experiences.<br><br>
